# Music!

Create a simple app containing songs divided by artist, album, and genre. The app should have a list of artists, albums, and genres. When you click on an artist, you should see a list of albums by that artist. When you click on an album, you should see a list of songs on that album. 

Also implement search functionality. The app should use mySQL to store the data. For now, just worry with making the app work locally.
